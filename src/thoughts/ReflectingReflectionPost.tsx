            What does that even mean? What exactly does it mean for one to work on themselves? And, more importantly, how does one determine that they've <em>successfully</em> worked on themselves?
            In some cases, this concept makes total sense. People can start dieting or exercising to reach health and fitness goals, objectively bettering themselves in a physical sense.
            But this phrase &mdash; "I'm working on myself" &mdash; is typically used in an emotional context. You hear this after someone goes through a breakup, the loss of a loved one, or some other similarly introspection-inducing event in one's life. Inspired by the hit 2024 movie <em>Inside Out 2</em>, in which the phrase "I'm a good person" was a tenet of character, I set out to better understand this.

            It's exceedingly simple to declare to the world that you're working on yourself. But what do you actually do? Step 1 is often cited to be acknowledgement of some problem.
            But that's obvious, isn't it? What's there to work on if there isn't a problem to solve? This has never made sense to me. Perhaps more puzzling is the idea that this is
            supposedly the most difficult step. I can understand this perspective for certain problems: acknowledging an alcohol addiction is indeed the first step in
            achieving sobriety. Is it the most difficult? I'm not sure &mdash; if former alcohol addicts claim this is the case, then I suppose it must be true. But I simply can't fathom
            how this can be the most difficult step in fundamentally bettering yourself in an emotional or human sense.
          </p>
          <p>
            Therein lies what I consider this phrase to most often represent: a fundamental emotional or human betterment of oneself. Something after which you could reflect on a prior period and concretely identify a worse version of yourself. Ideally, after this period of reflection, you'd be able to say in plain language that you'd improved in X, Y, and Z ways. Confidently, and without lying. This to me seems an impossible task. How can you possibly determine the exit criteria for this period of self-improvement? When have you become a better person?

            The easiest example I can use is that of a breakup. It's easy to claim, "I'm going to work on myself," in an attempt to discover your flaws as a partner, and how you can rectify
            mistakes you've made to improve your future relationships. How exactly do you achieve that, though? Let's work through an example: imagine a pain point in your past relationship was that you were easily irritable &mdash; you were prone to mood swings or were easily upset by trivial issues that were potential out of your partner's control. Having broken up, you now wish to "work on yourself" such that you're a less irritable person, and are less inclined to lash out at people around you for issues that are not their fault. Great! You've achieved Step 1: acknowledging you have a problem. Now, the hard part: actually becoming less irritable. How can you convert this reflection into learning?
          </p>
          <p>
            I was so interested in this idea when I first thought of it that I surveyed my friends for their opinions. After all, how often are the questions produced by self-reflection answered by self-reflection? So, I tried to answer self-reflection with group reflection. The first suggestion was that you would <em>become more aware</em> of this flaw (irritability) the next time it arises, leading you to self-consciously attempt to suppress it. This is only a partially satisfying answer to me. It feels all too easy to artificially inflate your awareness of a type of issue by imagining scenarios where you've improved. For example, you can observe an action or event, and claim that it previously would have irritated you when, in reality, it never would have. I suppose you could avoid this by exclusively observing your irritability in the face of scenarios that actually irritated you in the past. But how often are you <em>really</em> encountering an identical situation as one from the past?

            <em>Disclaimer: I will now attempt to apply an engineering perspective. This is, in fairness, a terrible idea. Systemic thought and emotion are seemingly orthogonal.</em>

            In computer science, we frown upon hard-coding expected values, whether in tests or production. It's simply not a scalable approach to developing robust and consistent software. This essentially means we should write systems that are generalizable and abstracted such that they apply to a class of problems, as opposed to individual problems in the set. Should this not also apply to a framework for self-development? Consider once more the case of irritability. Suppose you've <em>always</em> hated someone's laugh, and you always found a way to let them know &mdash; perhaps subtly via facial expressions, or by directly telling them. The core issue here is that you are easily irritable and enforce your unreasonable expectations upon others (e.g. a subjectively acceptable laughing style), <em>not</em> that you have demonstrated this expectation in this one specific situation. You can "hard-code" (see disclaimer) this scenario as one to avoid: next time you hear this person's laugh, you consciously suppress any desire to demonstrate your displeasure. I see two issues with this. 
          </p>
          <p>
            The first is that you aren't actually any less irritable; you just aren't displaying it in this context anymore. How can you solve the core issue of irritability? Maybe therapy. I'm not sure. Anyways, attempting a solution isn't the same as declaring the problem solved, and I'm more interested in finding out <em>when</em> a problem is solved than <em>how</em> &mdash; the exit criteria. The second is that this only makes you a marginally better person. You will now no longer lash out at this one person in this one specific scenario. What's stopping you from displaying your irritability in a totally different scenario, like talking to someone who overuses the word "like" in conversation? You can become a marginally better person each time you find yourself making a mistake in one of these situations and add it to your hard-coded (see disclaimer) list of situations to be aware of, but this isn't scalable. And if it's not a situation you've ever encountered before and haven't yet made a mistake, how can you be confident that you would've made a mistake (in this case, been irritable and expressed it) before you underwent this period of reflection? To claim as such would be artificial and self-indulgent, equivalent to a blanket statement of "I am a better person than before" with planted evidence.

            The second point brought up during group reflection was that acknowledgement of a problem is likely to eat at the psyche. Given that one understands a problem with themselves, they are likely to obsess over that issue when it arises. This is the human nature of insecurity. You're unlikely to magically forget about a flaw once you realize it exists. Therein lies a suggestion for an exit criteria &mdash; if you naturally find yourself thinking about an issue less, perhaps it is less of an issue. This is <em>probably</em> true, but not necessarily. There are a variety of reasons why you might think about a particular problem in your life with decreasing frequency or intensity. You might have other, more pressing problems that arise. You might be distracted by a generally eventful and chaotic period in your life that demands more attention, limiting your emotional bandwidth to introspect. You might only encounter situations that surface this issue very rarely. Sparsity of occurrence is a convenient excuse to claim that an issue is no longer an issue, and might not accurately reflect its state.

            I don't have a proper conclusion for this thought &mdash; I myself am still trying to determine how I can grow as a human and how that growth will reflect in my interactions with the people around me. We've all encountered someone who we know is genuinely a good person: you observe their actions and relationships and feel a desire to obtain that level of humanity. Consider viral videos of people helping the elderly, people who rescue endangered animals, or people who dedicate their lives to public service in exchange for limited compensation and personal benefit. These people undoubtedly have their own internal ideal of a good person, and have past experiences that developed their character. They've also undoubtedly made mistakes and undergone reflection of their own. To do so is innately human in itself. I suppose the answer is, then, that you'll never know yourself whether you've grown as a person. It's simply up to the people around you who've observed you, the way you act, and your relationships to make that judgement. Prompting those around you for clarity on this is chalked up to seeking validation, and is wholly unsatisfying. But what's the point of carrying the belief that you're a good person if nobody around you believes it? Maybe the validation is neither critical nor necessary. Validation may be elusive, but the pursuit of becoming a better person, however imperfect, is a worthy endeavor in itself.
